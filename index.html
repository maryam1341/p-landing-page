        <div id="ballet">1. Ballet 
                Tutus, pointe shoes and men in tights are what come to mind when someone mentions ballet. Yet Ballet is so much more than that. Said to be the most difficult genre to master, ballet is a rigorous style of dance that is the foundation of most forms of dance training. It is usually set, but not limited to, orchestrated music and is often the first dance style a child will experience as they begin their dance classes. Ballet shoes are usually worn until the dancer's feet have developed enough strength to progress into pointe shoes, often happens around the age of 12 and only after the students have been given permission by their teacher. Ballet is an excellent teaching tool for all dancers as it is a complex mixture of technique, coordination and musicality.

        <div id="Modern">2. Modern 
                Modern was said to be first created as a rebellion against classical ballet. A raw style of dance, modern dance is an expression on the dancers' relationship to the floor, including methods of contractions, release and movement, as well as the dancer's of breath. Modern dancers have a variety of shoes to choose from that allow freedom in the foot while providing protection from the floor. Though its roots are in opposition to the seemingly oppressive rigour for classical ballet, modern and ballet are closely linked in the complexity of technique, coordination and musicality.

        <div id="Jazz">3. Jazz
                Jazz is the most popular style of dance among dancers.
                 Jazz combines all dance styles in a high energetic dance that is without conventional boundaries. It has been influenced by ballet, modern, tap,
                  hip-hop, African dance and many more styles. Jazz is most often accompanied by upbeat, currently popular songs. Jazz shoes typically have a leather
                   split sole which offers the dancers foot more freedom to bend and move. Due to the upbeat music, dramatic themes and cool choreography, it isnâ€™t hard to
                    see why this is the most popular dance style!
